# VSTS Open Work Items in Excel #

**Important: This extension requires every user to have Microsoft Excel and Visual Studio '15' installed on device used.**
This extension enables opening works items in Excel, which may be helpful for editing multiple work items (bulk editing) or for analyzing and visualizing a large amount of work items. Work items that are opened in Excel can be edited and published back to Visual Studio Team Services.  

###Open an entire query in Excel for editing, data analysis and more
To open an entire query in Excel, go to Work > Queries and select the query you'd like to open. After installing this extension on your project, you'll see the option to "Open in Excel" when you right-click on the selected query.

###Select multiple work items and open them in Excel
Sometimes, you might want visibility into a few work items out of a query. From Work > Queries, select the work items you'd like to open (hold Shift to select multiple consecutive work items or Ctrl to select multiple work items). Right-click on selected work items, and you'll see the option to "Open in Excel."
